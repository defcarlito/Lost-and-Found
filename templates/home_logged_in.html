                1Ô∏è‚É£ You find an item around campus that looks like it was lost. So, you hold onto it and post it on this site
                as a lost item searching for its owner.
            </p>
            <p>
                2Ô∏è‚É£ You lost an item around campus and are panicked. You don't know who to ask or where you lost it. So, you visit
                this site and browse through the posts of lost items and there it is... your item.

            <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer!</h2>
            <p>
                The idea of this site is built through the trust that you as the user will <strong>do the right thing:</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                - Don't try to claim items that aren't yours.
            </p>
            <p>
                - If you have a post up for a lost item and someone reaches out to you, it would be 
                best practice to get them to prove that the item is truly theirs, expecially if the item is of higher value.
